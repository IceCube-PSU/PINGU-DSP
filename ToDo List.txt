To do list:
   Evaluate "S/N" by calculating ratio of post-filter pulse peak height to RMS of earlier part of waveform.
   Evaluate MPE response of pulses using IceCube data (Martin Roengen can help obtain)
   Ringing can occur due to numerical precision issues.
   Try adding sharp bipolar pulse to signal to check IIR stability.
   Try adding shifting baseline, or step function baseline shift.
